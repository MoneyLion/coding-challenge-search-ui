# Search UI Code Challenge

Welcome to the Search UI coding challenge. You will be asked to build a small
application demonstrating your abilities in React and TypeScript. This challenge
is targeted towards mid to senior level engineers.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Create a simple UI that meets the requirements below
3. Compress your work into a .zip file that includes your name and email it back to us for review.
 
### Additional Notes

* Use any libraries you like, keeping performance and bundle size in mind
* Use any UI framework you like, but don't spend too much time here
* This challenge should only take an hour or two

## Development

Install dependencies using `npm install`.

Run `npm start` to concurrently start the server and UI in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the UI in the 
browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### API

* The API server is run on port `3001` while the React UI is run on port `3000`
* Your UI can call `/api/data?search=[some-query]` directly since 
the request will be proxied to `http://localhost/api/data?...`
* You will to need access the API on port `3001` if you're testing it directly 
  from outside your application (e.g. http://localhost:3001/api/data?search=credit)
